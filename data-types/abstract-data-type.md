# Abstract Data Type (ADT)

An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a model for a data structure that defines:

1. **Data Representation**: The way data is conceptually organized and stored (not implementation-specific).
2. **Operations**: The set of operations that can be performed on the data, along with their behavior.

ADT focuses on *what* operations are available and *what* they do, rather than *how* they are implemented.

## Example: Integer in C

```c
int x;

// Conceptual Representation: An integer value, typically stored in 2 or 4 bytes depending on the system.
// For example, on many systems, an int is 4 bytes (32 bits). The most significant bit is often used for the sign (positive/negative).

// Allowed Operations: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), 
// % (modulus), ++ (increment), -- (decrement)
```
