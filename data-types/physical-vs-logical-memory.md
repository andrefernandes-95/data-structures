## Physical vs Logical Memory Structures

### Physical Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Contiguous memory allocation, fixed size.
- **Linked Lists**: Nodes linked via pointers, dynamic size.

### Logical Data Structures

#### Linear Structures
1. **Stacks**  
    - Principle: Last In, First Out (LIFO)
    - Example Operations: `push`, `pop`
2. **Queues**  
    - Principle: First In, First Out (FIFO)
    - Example Operations: `enqueue`, `dequeue`

#### Non-Linear Structures
3. **Trees**  
    - Hierarchical structure, nodes with parent/child relationships.
    - Example: Binary Tree, AVL Tree
4. **Graphs**  
    - Set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
    - Types: Directed, Undirected

#### Tabular Structures
5. **Hash Tables**  
    - Key-value pairs, fast lookup via hashing.

### Summary

- **Physical structures** define how data is stored in memory.
- **Logical structures** define how data is organized and accessed.
